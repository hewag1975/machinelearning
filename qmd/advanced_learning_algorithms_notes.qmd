## Neural networks

* neural networks = deep learning algorithms
* inference: take a pre-trained NN and make predictions
* traditional algorithms (linear, logistic regression) do not scale with amount of data
* activation function takes input and creates output, e.g. by logistic regression
* layer: group of n neurons (1..n), connected to the same input features
* output layer: final layer delivering the output
* input layer: first layer with features
* hidden layer: combines inputs from earlier layers to new features
* input $x$, activation $a$
* activations: logistic regressions that generate new features
* activations: higher level features
* architecture: number of hidden layers and hidden units per layer
* "multilayer perceptron": NN with multiple hidden layers


### Notation

* $a^l=g(w^l_j*a^{l-1}+b^l_j)$
* $a$ is the activation
* $l$ is the layer
* $j$ is the unit / neuron

* inference = making predictions, forward propagation
